# major-project 2021

The major project for MTRN4230 is a chance to simulate and implement an industrial robot system. Working in groups, define an application of your choosing that includes at least one robot manipulator and a vision system. Implement this in simulation and include a demonstration using the real UR5e (with a [ePick vacuum gripper](https://www.universal-robots.com/plus/urplus-components/handling-grippers/epick/) installed) and camera system.

For my Groups major project we used the Robotic Arm to start a company that plays games initially beginning with connect 4. The robot arm is manipulated to pick up counters and drop them into the playing grid when a player makes a move.

To see the operation through gazebo virtual world follow the instructions of the READ.ME through the folders:
